# Quay
>[!NOTE]
>A part of a StopPlace where passengers can board and alight vehicles  
(e.g., bus bay, train platform, or airport gate).
>
>### Important:
> - A name should **not** be set per Quay (it is inherited from the parent [StopPlace)](/10-Objects/StopPlace.markdown).
>- `QuayType` should **not** be specified, but instead derived from `TransportMode` / `StopPlaceType` (as the NeTEx profile does not allow modeling of multimodal Quays under the same StopPlace).
